== Description ==

### All the other WordPress audio players were crappy or ugly so I made a better one.  
  
![WPaudio](http://wpaudio.com/screenshot.png)

Deactivate that lame Flash player and install a plugin that makes you proud to embed mp3s. WPaudio installs in seconds, looks great, and uses simple tags... all without bulky files or affecting page load times.

#### Easy to install, easy to use

Install directly from WordPress (just go to *Plugins* -> *Add New*) and start embedding mp3s immediately. Now you can choose to convert all mp3 links or only the ones you select, and you still have the power of advanced tags.

#### Clean design with intuitive controls

Everything's tucked out of the way until you click play. Jog the track by clicking the position bar. Simple.

#### Compatible with your old audio player tags

Want to switch to a better player? Just deactivate your old plugin and let WPaudio give your old posts the dignity they deserve. WPaudio is compatible with Audio Player tags, with support for more on the way.

#### Won't slow down your site

WPaudio was written for performance.  It uses the WordPress's built-in scripts and the lightweight SoundManager2 library.

### How to use WPaudio

* If you want to convert every mp3 link into a player, go to *Settings* -> *WPaudio* and select the first option, *Convert all mp3 links*.

* If you want to selectively convert mp3 links, just add the `wpaudio` class to the links you want converted, like this:

		<a href="http://url.to/your.mp3" class="wpaudio">Artist - Song</a>
	
* If you want to disable downloads or specify a different download URL, use the advanced tags.

		[wpaudio url="http://url.to/your.mp3" text="Artist - Song" dl="0"]
		
* For autoplay, just add autoplay="1" to your tags.

		[wpaudio url="http://url.to/your.mp3" text="Artist - Song" autoplay="1"]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Find solutions, ask questions, and give feedback at the [WPaudio forum](http://wpaudio.com/forum/).

= It's not working! =

For best results, upgrade to the latest WordPress.

1. Try changing to the default theme.  Does it work now?  If so, make sure your theme has `wp_head();` and `wp_footer();`.
1. Try deactivating your other plugins and reactivating them one by one.  Let me know when you find the one causing the conflict.
1. Make sure the domain in your MP3 URLs matches the domain in your WordPress blog URL setting.
1. Check the [forum](http://wpaudio.com/forum/) and make a new post if you don't find a solution.

= How do I tell WPaudio which links to make into players? =

Just add the `wpaudio` class to those links.  If there's already a class, add it inside the quotes after a space (`class="anotherclass wpaudio"`).

	<a href="http://url.to/your.mp3" class="wpaudio">Artist - Song</a>

If you want to convert all mp3 links, just check the first option when you go to *Settings* -> *WPaudio*.  Then you don't have to add the class, but it won't hurt.

= I use (some other mp3 player).  Do I have to go back and change ALL my tags? =

Nope.  If you used Audio Player, just tell WPaudio to handle it on the *Settings* -> *WPaudio* page.  If you used another plugin, email me and I'll get support for it into the next version.

= With the advanced tags, should I include the text and dl parameters? (Can I specify what shows up next to the player?) =

Always include the *text* parameter (though it is optional).  This will reduce load on your server and make your pages prettier.  If you don't, the player starts out with the filename and has to load up part of the mp3 to figure out what text should be displayed.

The *dl* parameter isn't required.  See the next question.

= What if I don't want readers to download the mp3 from my server? =

Allow users to download from a file host by adding the *dl* parameter to your shortcode like this.

	[wpaudio url="http://url.to/your.mp3" dl="http://download-host.com/mp3_download_url"]
	
Or disable downloads by setting *dl* to "0" like this.

	[wpaudio url="http://url.to/your.mp3" dl="0"]
